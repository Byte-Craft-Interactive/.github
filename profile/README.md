## Our Work

**Pathfinders**

A cooperative third-person survival shooter set in a procedurally generated maze filled with hostile enemies, environmental hazards, and dynamic events. Players must work together to explore, fight, and overcome randomized challenges while managing limited resources and uncovering hidden secrets.

Built in Unity, the game features modular weapon systems, class-based roles, dynamic AI, environmental puzzles, and branching event outcomes that emphasize tactical decision-making and replayability.
